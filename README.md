**Plinker-RPC**
=========

Plinker PHP RPC client/server makes it really easy to link and execute PHP component classes on remote systems, while maintaining the feel of a local method call.

Development repository
----------------------

This repository is used to develop the entire project to make it easy to work on many parts at the same time without forgetting what was done,
it contains a bash script which will commit and do semantic versioning for each sub component.

## Installing

 - `git clone git@github.com:plinker-rpc/development.git .`
 - `composer install`

## Committing Changes

Bash scripts have been added to automate this, do not do it manually.

 - `bash ./commit.sh "A really informative commit message, and not just ."`

The above 1 liner will ask:

Do you wish to [c]ommit, [d]eploy or [e]xit?

 - If you choose commit, it will push your changes and docs to github.
 - If you choose commit, it will ask: Which type of changes has been done: [p]atch, [m]inor, [M]ajor? Upon selection it will increment semantic version, tag then push your changes and docs to github.

**dev_mkdocs.sh** is used to write docs with hot reloading.
