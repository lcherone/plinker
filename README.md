**Plinker-RPC**
=========

Plinker PHP RPC client/server makes it really easy to link and execute PHP component classes on remote systems, while maintaining the feel of a local method call.

Development repository

This repository is used to develop the entire project to make it easy to work on many parts at the same time without forgetting what was done,
it contains a bash script which will commit and do semantic versioning for each sub component.

 - `composer install`

**Committing changes:**
